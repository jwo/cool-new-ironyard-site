              <h4>Partner, Chief Executive Officer</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Peter went to Vanderbilt University and studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn out their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful startup exits, he moved his family to Greenville, SC, where he helped start NEXT and build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Iron Barth.&quot;</p>

              <h4>Partner, Brand and Ops</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Eric was born and raised in Upstate SC, where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University, where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop, where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Doubleday. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

              <h4>Partner, Lead Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Mason was born and raised in Jackson, MS (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he has worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical.</p>

He grew up (a bit) and has since worked as an engineer and executive for Fortune 50 companies and has exited a handful of bootstrapped and VC-funded startups. He serves as partner and the head of people development and growth. At night he works on his small app called Desk.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Aubrey was born in Houston, TX, and raised in the Upstate of South Carolina, meaning she's a southern girl through and through. Before she was even halfway through with her degree at the University of South Carolina, she had already joined Peter to help run the first iteration of our Accelerator program when she wasn't in class. On campus she served as Philanthropy Chair then Recruitment Vice President for Alpha Delta Pi (largest chapter in the nation). Every summer since then she has returned to Greenville to keep us straight with her perfect organizational skills, type-A project management skills and her always-wonderful way with people.</p>

Although he used to weigh 300 pounds and make crying babies of Division I defensive linemen, he is now a gentle-hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, and fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His superhuman abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, and is an avid fly-fisherman.</p>

During his childhood there wasn't a sport he didn't play, but he eventually he re-directed his passion towards music and taught himself how to play guitar. Jeff spent his early career working in marketing and graphic design, starting out sweeping floors and eventually handling everything from client management to design and production. While on vacation visiting his brother in Spartanburg, he was introduced to Marty and The Iron Yard and his ticket was punched. Only two short weeks after that vacation he packed his bags and headed down south. An avid lover of the outdoors, the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains didn't hurt either.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston.  He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&amp;M with a BS in Biomedical Science.  He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between.  He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake.  He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals.  Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same “ah ha” moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

              <h4>Campus Director</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">George is the Tampa - St. Petersburg Campus Director. He is looking forward to becoming part of the growing startup and technology culture of the Tampa Bay area. With both a Bachelors and MBA degree in Marketing, he left the corporate world to focus on entrepreneurship. Both of his companies have been Internet focused, and he enjoys using technology to solve problems and inefficiencies. He has taught Entrepreneurship classes to 7th/8th graders and was one of the first facilitators to present Startup Weekend across the US. What drives George is seeing growth in communities, businesses and most importantly, individuals. Probably named for the character Curious George, he likes to learn about everything—a new musician, a different type of food, an interesting idea. His ideal weekend would combine all 3: a great meal at a small, local restaurant, the next night a musician or band at a small venue, followed the next day by a lecture where he could learn something new.</p>

She studied Math at Swarthmore College in not-so-sunny Pennsylvania, then fled the snow back to the south as soon as she could return, spending a few years in Chapel Hill studying Information Science at UNC and finally landing in Charleston, SC. She has spent most of the past seven years hanging out with developers in various capacities and has even picked up a little code herself. She spends her free time chasing her twin boys, pursuing the perfect gluten free cookie, and playing roller derby as her alter ego, Whippopotamus.</p>

              <h2>Laura Lindeman</h2>
              <h4>Assistant Campus Director &amp; Content Editor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Laura Lindeman is an all-around word nerd: avid reader, blogger, and occasional grammar pedant who has opinions about the Oxford comma. She comes to The Iron Yard after several years of working in the non-profit sector and is excited to translate her organizing skills into empowering the next generation of developers. Laura is a firm believer in the power of community and the ways technology brings people together, though sharing a delicious meal in person is even better. She has a soft spot for cardigans, funky earrings, and chocolate with peanut butter. When she's not writing or helping students with Ruby on Rails, you can often find her backpacking, bargain hunting, or trying out new recipes.</p>

              <h4>iOS Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Jo started as a designer while studying at the Creative Circus, which has cursed him with the need to critique any and all bad design implementation. After getting a taste of code as a web developer, he found his passion and constantly pushed himself to learn more. That journey led him his true love: building apps for mobile devices. After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards. His passion for education has never left, though, so he joined our team as an iOS instructor to help others discover the beauty of Objective-C.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Nick pursued a degree in Video Game Development from Full Sail, where he received his bachelor's in two years. He has since switched industries and started developing web applications...and he hasn't looked back. He moved to Charleston, SC, where he began consuming every bit of knowledge he could. While moving up the ranks at Jack Russell Software to become a Senior Developer (from apprentice in only 3.5 years!), he found a love for teaching motivated individuals everything he had to offer and decided to pursue a career in education. He is super excited to teach and share his passion for his craft (web applications) to students at The Iron Yard Academy.</p>

He finally settled with a Computer Science degree from the University of Texas and two security certifications from &quot;the man&quot;. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; some speaking arrangements at large conferences; and a consulting position that helped to round out his eccentricity with soft-skills, management exposure, and a place in the Houston community. Here at The Iron Yard, Matt works to break down concepts into delicious bite-sized morsels, meant to be enjoyed with crafty beer, memorable memes, and sophisticated southern and British &quot;humour&quot;.</p>

He has been a professional web developer for 8 years, though he took a short break to teach junior high. He quickly learned that the conventional ways of thinking about the world are insufficient to meet the needs of our society, and he thinks that learning about and teaching programming is one of the best ways to learn how to think about the world. He is a JavaScript and Ruby developer, though he simultaneously loves Haskell and has never written a working program in Haskell.</p>

(born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>
