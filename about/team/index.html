              <h4>Partner, Chief Executive Officer</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Peter went to Vanderbilt University and studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn out their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful startup exits, he moved his family to Greenville, SC, where he helped start NEXT and build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Iron Barth.&quot;</p>

              <h4>Partner, Brand and Ops</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Eric was born and raised in Upstate SC, where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University, where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop, where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Doubleday. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

              <h4>Partner, Lead Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Mason was born and raised in Jackson, MS (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he has worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Aubrey was born in Houston, TX, and raised in the Upstate of South Carolina, meaning she's a southern girl through and through. Before she was even halfway through with her degree at the University of South Carolina, she had already joined Peter to help run the first iteration of our Accelerator program when she wasn't in class. On campus she served as Philanthropy Chair then Recruitment Vice President for Alpha Delta Pi (largest chapter in the nation). Every summer since then she has returned to Greenville to keep us straight with her perfect organizational skills, type-A project management skills and her always-wonderful way with people.</p>

              <h4>Managing Director</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Marty is not your typical Managing Director. Although he used to weigh 300 pounds and make crying babies of Division I defensive linemen, he is now a gentle-hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, and fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His superhuman abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, and is an avid fly-fisherman.</p>

              <h4>Campus Manager</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Jeff was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH. During his childhood there wasn't a sport he didn't play, but he eventually he re-directed his passion towards music and taught himself how to play guitar. Jeff spent his early career working in marketing and graphic design, starting out sweeping floors and eventually handling everything from client management to design and production. While on vacation visiting his brother in Spartanburg, he was introduced to Marty and The Iron Yard and his ticket was punched. Only two short weeks after that vacation he packed his bags and headed down south. An avid lover of the outdoors, the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains didn't hurt either.</p>

She studied Math at Swarthmore College in not-so-sunny Pennsylvania, then fled the snow back to the south as soon as she could return, spending a few years in Chapel Hill studying Information Science at UNC and finally landing in Charleston, SC. She has spent most of the past seven years hanging out with developers in various capacities and has even picked up a little code herself. She spends her free time chasing her twin boys, pursuing the perfect gluten free cookie, and playing roller derby as her alter ego, Whippopotamus.</p>

Her love for all-things-Atlanta has driven her deep involvement with the crafter and maker communities, a sense of “togetherness” she’s excited to bring to The Iron Yard. She's keen on styling and graphic design, always keeping her feet on both sides of the fence when it comes to creative and technical abilities. Her passion for education will be a driving force in the direction of The Iron Yard - Atlanta, and she’s excited to grow the campus into an impactful and welcoming community.</p>

After getting a taste of code as a web developer, he found his passion and constantly pushed himself to learn more. That journey led him his true love: building apps for mobile devices. After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards. His passion for education has never left, though, so he joined our team as an iOS instructor to help others discover the beauty of Objective-C.</p>

              <h2>Nick Bucciarelli</h2>
              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Nick pursued a degree in Video Game Development from Full Sail, where he received his bachelor's in two years. He has since switched industries and started developing web applications...and he hasn't looked back. He moved to Charleston, SC, where he began consuming every bit of knowledge he could. While moving up the ranks at Jack Russell Software to become a Senior Developer (from apprentice in only 3.5 years!), he found a love for teaching motivated individuals everything he had to offer and decided to pursue a career in education. He is super excited to teach and share his passion for his craft (web applications) to students at The Iron Yard Academy.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security. He finally settled with a Computer Science degree from the University of Texas and two security certifications from &quot;the man&quot;. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; some speaking arrangements at large conferences; and a consulting position that helped to round out his eccentricity with soft-skills, management exposure, and a place in the Houston community. Here at The Iron Yard, Matt works to break down concepts into delicious bite-sized morsels, meant to be enjoyed with crafty beer, memorable memes, and sophisticated southern and British &quot;humour&quot;.</p>

              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Jacob has studied computer science and philosophy at a traditional university, gotten in an argument with a famous philosopher's daughter in a Carthusian monastery in Austria, lived with monks in the South Bronx, tricked people into agreeing to the tenants of the Communist Manifesto while working on an automotive assembly line, and loves thinking and learning about thinking and learning. He has been a professional web developer for 8 years, though he took a short break to teach junior high. He quickly learned that the conventional ways of thinking about the world are insufficient to meet the needs of our society, and he thinks that learning about and teaching programming is one of the best ways to learn how to think about the world. He is a JavaScript and Ruby developer, though he simultaneously loves Haskell and has never written a working program in Haskell.</p>

(born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>
