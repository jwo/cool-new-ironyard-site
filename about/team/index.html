              <h4>Partner, Chief Executive Officer</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Peter went to Vanderbilt University and studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn out their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful startup exits, he moved his family to Greenville, SC, where he helped start NEXT and build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Iron Barth.&quot;</p>

              <h4>Partner, Brand and Ops</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Eric was born and raised in Upstate SC, where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University, where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop, where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Doubleday. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

              <h4>Partner, Lead Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">Mason was born and raised in Jackson, MS (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he has worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">John is a hacker, writer, and lover of all things 8-bit. His first project of note was a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; quest in BASIC when he was 11. He grew up (a bit) and has since worked as an engineer and executive for Fortune 50 companies and has exited a handful of bootstrapped and VC-funded startups. He serves as partner and the head of people development and growth. At night he works on his small app called Desk.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Aubrey was born in Houston, TX, and raised in the Upstate of South Carolina, meaning she's a southern girl through and through. Before she was even halfway through with her degree at the University of South Carolina, she had already joined Peter to help run the first iteration of our Accelerator program when she wasn't in class. On campus she served as Philanthropy Chair then Recruitment Vice President for Alpha Delta Pi (largest chapter in the nation). Every summer since then she has returned to Greenville to keep us straight with her perfect organizational skills, type-A project management skills and her always-wonderful way with people.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Marty is not your typical Managing Director. Although he used to weigh 300 pounds and make crying babies of Division I defensive linemen, he is now a gentle-hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, and fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His superhuman abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, and is an avid fly-fisherman.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Jeff was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH. During his childhood there wasn't a sport he didn't play, but he eventually he re-directed his passion towards music and taught himself how to play guitar. Jeff spent his early career working in marketing and graphic design, starting out sweeping floors and eventually handling everything from client management to design and production. While on vacation visiting his brother in Spartanburg, he was introduced to Marty and The Iron Yard and his ticket was punched. Only two short weeks after that vacation he packed his bags and headed down south. An avid lover of the outdoors, the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains didn't hurt either.</p>

After receiving her MBA at the University of Tampa, she began to share the impact of how technology can help nonprofit organizations touch more people. Realizing the need for talented developers, she crossed paths with The Iron Yard who shares many of her same values. Her passion is people and believes technology can help people achieve better results, quicker. She is excited about the warm welcome from St. Petersburg/Tampa and looks forward to collaborating with the community to develop amazing developers who want to make awesome things.</p>

              <p style="font-size:16px">Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston.  He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&amp;M with a BS in Biomedical Science.  He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between.  He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake.  He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals.  Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same “ah ha” moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

She loves new stories and old books, and when she has free time, likes to experiment with crafting and sewing, as well as baking French pastries.</p>

After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards.

              <p style="font-size:16px">Hi! My name is Christopher Davies. I’ve been writing software ever since a friend convinced me that it was fun. (That was way back in 1999.) I’ve built projects ranging from shipping terminal management systems to MMORPG registration sites and everything in between. Over time, I’ve transitioned from building mostly native applications to building almost everything using standard web technology. Along the way, I’ve taught and mentored others — something that I’ve always found to be deeply rewarding. So what do you get when you combine love/knowledge of tech with love of teaching? The IronYard! That’s why I’m thrilled to be joining as a front end instructor. When I’m not busy hacking code, I may be found playing soccer, ultimate, or foos. Or maybe tinkering around on my guitar. Or hiking somewhere with my beautiful wife. Or painting. Or reading a good book. Or reading a bad book. Or writing sentence fragments.(photo taken from my wedding - it’s the only time our students will see me in a suit) </p>

He has been a professional web developer for 8 years, though he took a short break to teach junior high. He quickly learned that the conventional ways of thinking about the world are insufficient to meet the needs of our society, and he thinks that learning about and teaching programming is one of the best ways to learn how to think about the world. He is a JavaScript and Ruby developer, though he simultaneously loves Haskell and has never written a working program in Haskell.</p>

              <h2>Jesse Wolgamott</h2>
              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p style="font-size:16px">JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y’all. (born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>
