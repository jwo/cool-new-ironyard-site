        h3(style="margin-top:0px  ") The short story
        p We’re hiring programming instructors and campus directors to launch code schools in cities across the Southeast. Check out the open positions below, and be sure to read about our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and <a href="#culture">culture</a>.
        h1#instructors Programming instructors
        hr
        p We're looking for:
        ul 
          li iOS instructors
          li Ruby on Rails instructors
          li Front End Engineering (JavaScript) instructors
          li Enterprise-level Java instructors
          li Python instructors
        p If you live and breathe code as your craft; find joy in helping other people learn it too; and want a huge amount of time to pursue freelance, personal projects, or open source work, then this job was custom-made for you.
        h4 Educational values
        p First and most importantly, here are a few of our values when it comes to teaching someone how to be a developer:
        ul
          li <strong>Thing over syntax</strong> -  We believe syntax is the easy part of programming and that we are successful when we’ve helped someone learn to think like an engineer.
          li <strong>Quality over quantity</strong> – We’re interested in training true professionals, not getting as many people into our classes as possible.
          li <strong>Real projects over scripted assignments</strong> – People learn programming best by tackling hard problems with a mentor, not following a list of steps and taking a quiz.
          li <strong>Emphasis on open source</strong> – We deeply value the open source mindset and intentionally create and contribute to open source projects.
        h4 What the role and responsibilities look like
        p
          | Our instructors serve as lecturers and mentors to our students, helping them learn to think like engineers and hone their skills in a programming discipline. You’ll also help define and refine the curriculum to stay current with cool new stuff. Here’s a peek at the <a href="/academy/front-end-engineering">Front End Engineering</a> course we’ve already launched.<br><br>
          | You’ll teach three, three-month semesters each year. The remaining three months you’ll only have light duties for The Iron Yard, such as curriculum updates and interviewing students for future classes. Beyond those things, you’re free to work on whatever you want (such as personal projects, open source projects, or products that we’re building and launching as The Iron Yard). And, of course, you’ll want to take some well-deserved time off.<br><br>
          | Each class will be 15 students (no more), and you will have an admin/campus director to take care of all the non-teaching-critical parts of running a program.<br><br>
          | Outside of teaching responsibilities, you’ll be an active part of the development community in your city (hopefully you already are).

          | The world has huge problems that need to be solved, many of which technology is perfectly suited to address. Companies full of designers and developers around the globe are answering this call, but there’s a problem: there aren’t enough of them. While data shows a current surplus of American graduates with STEM degrees, anyone on the ground in the tech industry has felt the acute shortage of high-quality developers. What’s more, over the next 10 years there will be <em>1.4 million jobs in computer science but only 400,000 qualified graduates</em>.<br><br>
          | The Iron Yard is a solution at that juncture of supply, demand, and a broken education system. We are committed to training the highest-quality developers in the world, both in skill and in character. Our mission is to find people who want to pursue the <em>craft</em> and <em>life-long adventure</em> of programming, teach them the tools of the trade, teach them how to teach themselves, and then release them into the world with the drive and capability to make a difference. We believe that passionate, talented people who love what they do will create great families, jobs, companies, and solutions to the world’s problems.<br><br>
          | We want to accomplish this alongside talented, passionate people who share our vision, love what they do, and want to have a whole lot of fun along the way.

          | If you walk into The Iron Yard on any given afternoon, you’re as likely to see an engineering team architecting software as you are to see a group enjoying craft brews over ping pong and video games.<br><br>
          | We’ve been told we’re a “work hard, play hard” crew, and we couldn’t agree more. Our standards for producing awesome stuff are extremely high, but so is our capacity to truly enjoy life alongside the people we work with.<br><br>
          | Here are a few characteristics of how we work:
        ul
          li <em>People first, always</em> – We absolutely love what we get to do everyday, but more importantly we’re passionate about who we get to do it with and the entrepreneurs and students we get to serve—they’re the reason we come to work.
          li <em>Flat structure and highly entrepreneurial</em> – We don’t manage people, we give them a goal and let them use their skills to accomplish it in the best way possible. This can be difficult if you like a lot of structure and daily direction. For the self-starter types, though, it’s vocational bliss.
          li <em>Open mindset</em> – The Iron Yard is an open place for people of all kinds; we don’t believe in molds, stereotypes, or any sort of discrimination. Also, we don’t believe in artificial scarcity—if we can help someone, we will. If a project can have a bigger impact being open-sourced, we’ll open source it.
          li <em>‘Being home for dinner’ policy</em> – We work really hard, but a constantly imbalanced life isn’t healthy for anyone. We work fast, efficient, and fun so that we can invest in important areas of life outside the office
