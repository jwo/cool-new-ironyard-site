          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing how to spin up a Rails app doesn't make you a great programmer; that’s the easy part of Rails development. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you think like an engineer. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level Rails devs. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, from foundational concepts to complex frameworks. Some topics like JSON AJAX requests will take weeks to cover, while others like using Active Helper will be taught in just a few lectures. Each instructor and class stays agile so that the curriculum can adapt as tools and languages evolve, but we ensure that each student graduates with the same core skillset.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.

(The average student puts in about 60 hours per week, minimum). We don’t require you to know code to start with, but you need to have tried it and enjoyed it.
