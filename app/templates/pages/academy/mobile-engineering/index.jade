          | Over the course of three months, a practicing iOS nerd (and skilled instructor) will teach you the ins-and-outs of iOS app development using Xcode 5 and a whole lot of Objective-C. At the end of the class you’ll have the skills to create beautiful, fully functional iOS apps and the foundation to pursue building Mac apps as well.<br><br>
          | The best part: we’ll help you get a job offer as a mobile developer when you graduate (or your tuition back, <em>guaranteed</em>). Don’t know any code? Don’t worry. Our proven teachers and process will take you from zero to hero and mentor you into a professional junior-level programmer.

The schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend’s homework.

        p Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive and fun. All of our instructors use a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.

        p You’ll have homework every single day…and it ain’t easy. All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn’t keep you busy enough, we start sending you real, paid freelance work. You’ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil.

We also partner with guest speakers who cover a variety of topics like design and freelancing, and we take class field trips to real businesses like MailChimp and BMW. Employers have told us our grads are some of the most well-rounded, teachable hires they’ve ever made.

          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing Objective-C doesn’t make you’re great at building apps; that’s the easy part of mobile development. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you think like an engineer. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level mobile devs. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, learning everything below and then some. Some topics like Core Libraries will take weeks to cover, and others like Objects and Classes will be taught in just a few lectures.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.

        p 
          | Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be very challenging. The material gets really hard, really fast. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you’re going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn’t the place for you. (The average student puts in about 60 hours per week, minimum). We don’t require you to know code to start with, but you need to have tried it and enjoyed it. If that’s you, go ahead and <a href="#class-schedule">apply now</a>. If not, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectivec-basics">try a few exercises to see.</a><br><br>
          | We’re family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find joy in a great job, freelance work, or starting your own company when you’re done. We’re proud of all of the different types of people who have come through The Iron Yard, and we don’t have stereotypes of what a programmer is like. We’ve taught students from 18 to 50 years old, from different countries and all sorts of backgrounds.
        h3: em How Much Does It Cost?
        p <strong>Base tuition is $10,000</strong>, and we have significant discounts for enlisted military personnel and veterans, and not to mention a <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/scholarships">Women in Tech Scholarship</a>.

          | If you need to be micro-managed, this isn’t the place for you.<br><br>
          | <strong>Works Well With Others</strong><br>
          | You’ll be assigned to groups for projects, and each person’s role will be crucial.<br><br>
          | <strong>Interested in Learning</strong><br>
          | Even if you know basics (or more), you might have to unlearn some things. We’ll start from the ground up as a team, and there won’t be room for egos.<br><br>
          | <strong>Graceful Problem Solver</strong><br>
          | We’ll work on some hard, frustrating stuff. Patience and endurance are necessities.<br><br>
          | <strong>Ready to Have Fun</strong><br>
          | We work hard, play hard, and laugh every single day. We do the best work we possibly can, but we make sure not to take ourselves too seriously.
