          | Over the course of three months, a heavy-duty programming veteran (and skilled teacher) will show you the power of Python, one of the most powerful languages in the world for web applications, big data, and scientific computing. At the end of the class you’ll make magic happen with real-world data sets and you'll know how to build web apps to show off your wizardry.<br><br>
          | The best part: we’ll help you get a job offer as a Python developer when you graduate. Don’t know any code? Don’t worry. Our proven teachers and process will take you from zero to hero and mentor you into a professional junior-level programmer.

The schedule is set up like a typical five-day work week, with lecture in the morning and lab time in the afternoon. Friday is an open lab day where students can work with the instructor to catch up on projects or get a head start on the weekend’s homework.

        p Our lessons are fast-paced, interactive and fun. All of our instructors use a hands-on, live-coding lecture style so that students immediately start developing muscle memory for each new skill. We cover a new subject almost every day, building on previous material. The goal is for you to get your hands dirty absorbing a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab.

All assignments are cumulative and ultimately lead up to a final project (unique to each student) that is the crown of your portfolio. If that doesn’t keep you busy enough, we start sending you real, paid freelance work. You’ll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil.

          | We put serious focus on the qualitative aspects of work, from team projects to mock job interviews. We also partner with guest speakers who cover a variety of topics like design and freelancing, and we take class field trips to real businesses like MailChimp and BMW. Employers have told us our grads are some of the most well-rounded, teachable hires they’ve ever made.

          | Just knowing punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer. In the same sense, just knowing how to download and use someone else's libraries doesn't make you a great programmer; that’s the easy part of Python development. The emphasis in all of our classes is on helping you think like an engineer. Programming is a lifelong study, and our goal is for you to learn how to learn so you remain highly valuable for the rest of your career.<br><br>
          | That being said, you’ll leave our class with a toolbox of skills that will set you far apart from other junior-level Python devs. You’ll cover an incredible amount of ground in 3 months, from foundational concepts to complex frameworks. Some topics like machine learning will take weeks to cover, while others like using REST will be taught in just a few lectures. Each instructor and class stays agile so that the curriculum can adapt as tools and languages evolve, but we ensure that each student graduates with the same core skillset.<br><br>
          | No matter your learning pace, we keep our class sizes small so that we can spend individual time with each student and make sure no one falls behind.

            | Master Git for personal and team workflows. All of your code will live on GitHub from day one.<br><br>
            | <strong>Python Fundamentals</strong><br>
            | We’ll start with object oriented principles and apply them in the specific context of the Python language.<br><br>
            | <strong>NumPy and SciPy</strong><br>
            | Scientific computing starts with NumPy and SciPy.  Wield these tools in your battle against data sets to discover things that are truly fascinating.<br><br>
            | <strong>Machine Learning Concepts</strong><br>
            | With great power comes great responsibility.  Delve into clustering, regression and classification using tools like neural networks and support vector machines.<br><br>
            | <strong>Freelance fundamentals</strong><br>
            | Seasoned pros show you how to find good work, write contracts, set expectations, price well and communicate like a pro.<br><br>
            | <strong>Testing, Testing, Testing</strong><br>
            | No code should be written without proper testing. We will do our fair share throughout the entire course.<br><br>
            | <strong>The Django Framework</strong><br>
            | We’ll cover web app structure, routes, APIs, SQL interfaces, migrations, relationships and much, much more.  You'll use these tools to share your insights with the world.<br><br>

            | <strong>Databases</strong><br>
            | Databases are essential tools in all types of computing.  We'll dig into PostreSQL and learn how to use it both with and without Django.<br><br>
            | <strong>HTML and CSS</strong><br>
            | We will cover HTML and CSS foundations and utilize preprocessors to streamline your work.<br><br>
            | <strong>Provisioning and Deployment</strong><br>
            | Writing computationally intensive code means that you need to pay attention to how and where you run it.  Learn about creating and sizing virtual machines, then automatically install what you need with provisioning tools like Ansible. Learn how to move your application from development to production and keep it up to date with tools like Fabric.<br><br>
            | <strong>Getting Hired</strong><br>
            | We do mock interviews, resume writing and portfolio building. Grads have weekly meetings with our team to help find exciting jobs and projects.

        p 
          | Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be very challenging. The material gets really hard, really fast. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you’re going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn’t the place for you. (The average student puts in about 60 hours per week, minimum). We don’t require you to know code to start with, but you need to have tried it and enjoyed it. If that’s you, go ahead and <a href="#class-schedule">apply now</a>. If not, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">try a few exercises to see.</a><br><br>
          | We’re family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find joy in a great job, freelance work, or starting your own company when you’re done. We’re proud of all of the different types of people who have come through The Iron Yard, and we don’t have stereotypes of what a programmer is like. We’ve taught students from 18 to 50 years old, from different countries and all sorts of backgrounds.
        h3: em How Much Does It Cost?
        p You can read about tuition, financing and scholarships on our <a href="/academy/tuition">Tuition page</a>. We offer great financing options, have significant discounts for enlisted military personnel/veterans, and sponsor a Women in Tech Scholarship.

          | If you need to be micro-managed, this isn’t the place for you.<br><br>
          | <strong>Works Well With Others</strong><br>
          | You’ll be assigned to groups for projects, and each person’s role will be crucial.<br><br>
          | <strong>Interested in Learning</strong><br>
          | Even if you know basics (or more), you might have to unlearn some things. We’ll start from the ground up as a team, and there won’t be room for egos.<br><br>
          | <strong>Graceful Problem Solver</strong><br>
          | We’ll work on some hard, frustrating stuff. Patience and endurance are necessities.<br><br>
          | <strong>Ready to Have Fun</strong><br>
          | We work hard, play hard, and laugh every single day. We do the best work we possibly can, but we make sure not to take ourselves too seriously.
