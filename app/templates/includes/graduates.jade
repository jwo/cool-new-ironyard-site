      description: 'I recently graduated from a three-month Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard. The work in my portfolio represents long hours plugging away at assignments for the class. I titled my final project chess.js, and I am most satisfied with this endeavor. Besides hacking away at something that is way over my head, I also enjoy running, especially trail running. My last big race was the Bel Monte 50 Miler back in April of ‘13. I hope to run a 100 miler some day',

      description: 'After five years working at Apple Stores, my brother and I created a small startup called Surprise Co. At the same time, I created my own company called App Shirt Co. I am still working on both. In August 2013, I moved to Greenville, SC to take a 12-week intensive front-end engineering class. There I learned the skills necessary to become a true developer. I am currently looking for a web development position with a progressive, growth-oriented company that offers challenging opportunities and responsibilities with the potential for career advancement. I am willing to relocate for the perfect position.',

      description: 'Learning how to write code has been an experience unlike anything else. It wasn’t simply learning a new skill. It was learning a new way of thinking. I learned to look at all areas of the problem and analyze them before making a decision. This new way of thinking has taught me to look at all problems differently, whether they involve programming or everyday life. As I move forward, I’m excited to continue to grow, learn and continue to improve upon my thinking and problem solving abilities.',
